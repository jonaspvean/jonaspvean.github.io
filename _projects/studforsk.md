[StudForsk](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/studforsk/start) is an initiative that is meant to introduce undergraduate students to self-studying and mathematical research, as well as prompting these students to communicate and share their research processes with more senior members of the mathematical community around them. 


This project was pitched to me early on in my university studies, were I was suggested by Dr. Gabriele Brüll to meet with professor Mats Ehrnström to discuss the potential project. We decided on something that would adjoin the world of partial differential equations and that of differential geometry. I was particularly interested in differential geometry at the time, hence the inclusion of symplectic geometry and manifold theory.  

The project was supported with a grant of 10 000 NOK by the Olav Thon foundation when it was submitted in the summer of 2019. 

Note: the project is not found on the StudForsk page of completed projects since there were some corrections that needed to be made that I never got around to fixing.

My bachelor's thesis was written in the span of January to June of 2020 – just around the time COVID-19 pandemic had started. It was written under the supervision of professor Mats Ehrnström, who had also supervised the [StudForsk project](/projects/studforsk/) that I submitted the year prior to writing this thesis.

The thesis began as an exploration into the theory of local bifurcation. More accurately, it started as a self-study on the topic of local bifurcation theory as presented in the text by {% cite kielhofer_bifurcation_2012 %}. The final and perhaps optimistic goal of the thesis was to approach the topic of local bifurcation theory of a modified version of the fractional Korteweg–de Vries equation of the form 

$$ u_t + (L u)_x + (u^{p+1})_x = 0, \quad p \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}, $$

where the Fourier multiplier $$ L $$ satisfies $$ \mathscr{F}L (\xi) = (1+\xi²)^{s/2} $$ for $$ s < 0 $$. 

The thesis is primarily based on the methods laid out in an article by {% cite ehrnstrom_travelling_2009 %}.

My master's thesis, entitled *Global Bifurcation of a Nonlocal Equation*, was written in the span of August 2021 - October 5th 2022 under the supervision of Mats Ehrnstr√∂m. 

As part of the preamble, it covers some necessary theory that is needed to understand global bifurcation theory, the theory of distributions, and some function space theory related to the later analysis. The main course of the thesis is the global bifurcation analysis of travelling wave solutions to the nonlocal, nonlinear dispersive equation given by 

$$ u_t + (\Lambda^s u)_x + (u\, \Lambda^r u)_x = 0, $$

where $$u$$ is the function whose solution is desired, and $$ s, r < 0 $$ are parameters. Travelling solutions of the form $$ u(t,x) = \varphi(x-\mu t) $$, for some function $$\varphi$$ and wave speed $$ \mu \geq 0 $$, can integrate the equation above to the form 

$$ -\mu\varphi + \Lambda^s \varphi + \varphi\,\Lambda^r\varphi = B $$

for a constant of integration $$ B $$ (which in the thesis is taken to be zero). This latter equation is the subject of the global bifurcation analysis in the thesis. Much of the theory is based on the article {% cite ehrnstrom_whithams_2019 %}, but the challenges that arise from having a nonlocal nonlinear term $$ \varphi\,\Lambda^r\varphi $$ make for interesting observations about the nodal pattern theorems, monotonicity results, and whether or not the equation considered has a highest wave solution at all. Indeed, for $$ B = 0 $$, Theorem 4.4.2 in the thesis proves that a highest wave solution for the global bifurcation problem as above does not exist. 




In the aftermath of the thesis, I sought out to generalize and refine the analysis of the global bifurcation equation as above - namely by including the analysis for general constants $$ B $$. See the [project page](/projects/article_nonlocal_equation/) for more details.

  <p>[!note]
This is specifically a guide for upgrading Quartz 4 version to a more recent update. If you are coming from Quartz 3, check out the [[migrating from Quartz 3|migration guide]] for more info.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To fetch the latest Quartz updates, simply run</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npx quartz update
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As Quartz uses <a href="https://git-scm.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">git</a> under the hood for versioning, updating effectively ‘pulls’ in the updates from the official Quartz GitHub repository. If you have local changes that might conflict with the updates, you may need to resolve these manually yourself (or, pull manually using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git pull origin upstream</code>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!hint]
Quartz will try to cache your content before updating to try and prevent merge conflicts. If you get a conflict mid-merge, you can stop the merge and then run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npx quartz restore</code> to restore your content from the cache.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have the <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GitHub desktop app</a>, this will automatically open to help you resolve the conflicts. Otherwise, you will need to resolve this in a text editor like VSCode. For more help on resolving conflicts manually, check out the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line#competing-line-change-merge-conflicts" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GitHub guide on resolving merge conflicts</a>.</p>

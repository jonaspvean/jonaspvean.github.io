<p>Quartz was originally designed as a tool to publish Obsidian vaults as websites. Even as the scope of Quartz has widened over time, it hasn’t lost the ability to seamlessly interoperate with Obsidian.</p>

<p>By default, Quartz ships with the [[ObsidianFlavoredMarkdown]] plugin, which is a transformer plugin that adds support for <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Obsidian+Flavored+Markdown" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Obsidian Flavored Markdown</a>. This includes support for features like [[wikilinks]] and [[Mermaid diagrams]].</p>

<p>It also ships with support for <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">frontmatter parsing</a> with the same fields that Obsidian uses through the [[Frontmatter]] transformer plugin.</p>

<p>Finally, Quartz also provides [[CrawlLinks]] plugin, which allows you to customize Quartz’s link resolution behaviour to match Obsidian.</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>This functionality is provided by the [[ObsidianFlavoredMarkdown]], [[Frontmatter]] and [[CrawlLinks]] plugins. See the plugin pages for customization options.</p>

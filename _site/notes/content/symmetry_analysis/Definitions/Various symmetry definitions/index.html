<p>In Olver’s book <sup id="fnref:fn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> one encounters a fair few different notions of symmetries of equations. In this note we are going to overview a few of them briefly, and finally compare them against each other.</p>

<p>Throughout this note we let \(M = X \times U\) be the space of independent and dependent variables.</p>

<p>The first definition we will consider is the one concerning group actions on functions.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[!quote] Definition (Symmetry group)
A <em>symmetry group</em> of a system \(\mathscr{S}\) of differential equations is a local group of transformations \(G\) acting on an open subset of \(M\) such that whenever \(u = f(x)\) is a solution of \(\mathscr{S}\), and assuming the action \(g\cdot f\) is defined for \(g\in G\), then \(\tilde{u} = g\cdot f(x)\) is another solution to the system \(\mathscr{S}\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This definition is relatively straight-forward save for the intricacies of <em>local group of transformations</em>, which unfortunately also restricts what kind of solutions are permissible to the system \(\mathscr{S}\).</p>

Hello! My name is Jonas, and I am a Norwegian mathematician specializing in analysis and partial differential equations, with an emphasis on nonlinear dispersive equations. 

I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics from the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.edu/) in Trondheim, where I wrote my both my [bachelor thesis](/projects/bachelor_thesis/) and [master thesis](/projects/master_thesis/) under the supervision of professor Mats Ehrnström. 

Currently – and for the past year – I have been working independently on several projects: 
<ul>
  <li> An extension and deeper look into the nonlocal dispersive equation of the form \( u_t + (\Lambda^s u)_x + (u\,\Lambda^ru)_x = 0 \), whose initial analysis was the topic of my master's thesis. 
  </li> 
  <li> Lie symmetry analysis of a nonlocal family of dispersive equations with nonlinear Coifman–Meyer symbols.
  </li>
  <li> Various smaller programming projects aimed at exploring machine learning, numerical analysis, front-end development (this website!), and more. 
  </li>
</ul>


In my spare time I greatly enjoy listening to music, dabbling in E-sports and speedrunning, running, and hypertrophy-style weightlifting. Since June of 2023 I have been a regular at Holth's gym in Kristiansund, which is where I have been developing my passion for fitness with nearly daily sessions.
